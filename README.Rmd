The goal of wakastudio is to provide a seemless integration between RStudio and WakaTime. [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) is a time tracking tool for programmers. It tracks the time you spend in your code editor and logs the data to your WakaTime dashboard. This package provides a set of functions to interact with the WakaTime API.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wakastudio from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jdhoffa/wakastudio")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(wakastudio)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
